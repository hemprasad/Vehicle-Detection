1. Download latest version of OpenCV, then extract to program files
2. Follow instructions to set environment variable here: 
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html#windowssetpathandenviromentvariable
3. Use these two props files instead of making them as described here:
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_visual_studio_Opencv/windows_visual_studio_Opencv.html#windows-visual-studio-how-to

Note: check inside %OPENCV_DIR%\lib and adjust the props files to account for version number.
Example: opencv_calib3d249d.lib became opencv_calib3d2411d.lib
